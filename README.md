# NLP-Analogies

For this exercise we will be asking the model the **Analogy** questions:

### If Italy is to Italian then Spain is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### If India is to delhi then Japan is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

### If man is to  woman then boy is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

### If small is to  smaller then large is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   

Using a pre-trained GloVe word vector I will make a model that will accurately answer the questions above.
