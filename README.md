# NLP-Analogies

For this exercise we will be asking the model the **Analogy** questions:

### If Italy is to Italian then Spain is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### If India is to delhi then Japan is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

### If man is to  woman then boy is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

### If small is to  smaller then large is to? 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   

Using a pre-trained GloVe word vector I will make a model that will accurately answer the questions above.


## GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation
https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf

GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
